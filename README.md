# Summary
This is a sample app to quickly get started with the Yelp APIs.

The app is setup with Retrofit, a simple search API, and a couple of models with minimal fields to get you started.

You should modify the files in the `models` directory to add/remove any fields you feel are necessary.
Use the documentation provided by [Yelp](https://www.yelp.ca/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)
to help create your models.

The files provided are references to help you get started. You may choose to add additional API endpoints,
models, or fields to create an application you feel best fulfills the target requirements.

**Feel free to edit, replace or delete any files you feel are needed**

## Getting Started
Replace `api-key-here` in `app/build.gradle` with your API Key generated from https://www.yelp.ca/developers/v3/manage_app

There is a simple test included in the `YelpTest.java` class that you may run to verify that your API key is working.
